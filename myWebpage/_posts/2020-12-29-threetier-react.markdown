Collaborated with a partner to complete a three-tier web application for CSE 316, the Software Development class at Stony Brook.
The application had a React Frontend using fetch api to send HTTP get requests to the backend.
The NodeJS backend consumed those get requests and URI string to query the MySQL database and return a response to the frontend.

The application was able to authenticate users via the database, giving access for users to do CRUD operations depending on their permissions.
